# Advanced regression housing price assignment
> This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple lasso/ridge regression model to evalute variables that best predict the house prices. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same.

## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
> The company wants to know:
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
    - How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
> Train.csv

## Conclusions
Answer- The below mentioned variables are significant in predicting the price
- LotArea------------- Lot size in square feet
- OverallQual--------Rates the overall material and finish of the house
- Year remodelled------When was the house remoddeled
- Central air -----  if the house has centrally airconditon or not
- Lot shape --- shape of the lot 
- Garage finish ---- how well was the garage finished 
- Bedrooms above grade ---- How many bedrooms were above grade 
- Basmentexposure ------ Refered to walkout or garden level walls 
- BsmtFinSF1-------Type 1 finished square feet
